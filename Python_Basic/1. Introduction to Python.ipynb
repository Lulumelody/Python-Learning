There are several reasons why people decide to use Python instead of other languages\n","\n","### 1. 語言的高品質 Software Quality\n","比起其他編程語言，Python 令程式有更高可讀性，更容易重覆改寫和更容易管理。 此外，它支援更高級的軟件應用。(i.e. 物件導向程式設計 object-oriented programming (OOP))\n","\n","Python code is designed to be more readable, reusable and maintainable than other traditional scripting languages. Also, it supports advanced software mechanisms (i.e. object-oriented programming (OOP))\n","\n","### 2. 提高開發人員的生產力 Developer Productivity\n","Python 可提高開發人員的生產力，而且 Python 只有 Java 或 C++ 語言的三分之一至五分之一大小。開發人員因而只需輸入較少字，並減少了需要調整的地方。\n","\n","Python boosts developer productivity and Python code is around one-third to the one-fifth size of equivalent Java or C++ code. Developers have less to type and debug which boost up the productivity.\n","\n","### 3. 程式的高轉移性 Program Portability\n","幾乎所有的 Python 程式都能在沒有作出任何改寫下，在其他電腦上運作。\n","\n","Almost all of the Python programmes can be run on different computer platforms without making any alternation.\n","\n","### 4. 支持函式庫 Support Libraries\n","Python 有大量的預建和標準通用的函式庫。例如，代碼擴充 NumPy 就是一個免費且強力的數學編程系統，相等於有名的 Matlab。\n","\n","Python has a huge amount of prebuilt and standard library. For example, the NumPy extension is considered as a free and powerful equivalent to Matlab, which is a famous numeric programming system.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pXd3_tUpWbnM"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wt438IqNzHAG"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uRRVHa_Cy2bp"},"source":["## 執行代碼 Programme Execution\n","\n","### 從開發人員的角度而言 From the developer's point of view\n","一個 Python 程序就是一個有 Python 語言的文字檔案。事實上，只要在檔案名字後方加上 ` \".py\" `，我們能在任何文字編輯器上創作 Python 程序。在創建這一檔案後，我們能命令 Python `執行 ` 這個檔案。在執行時，所有程序語句會從上至下被執行。\n","\n","A Python programme is a text file containing Python Statements. In fact, we can create Python codes with any text editor as long as we give the file with a name that ends in `\".py\"` After such file is created, we can tell Python to `execute` the file. By executing the file, all the statements within the file are run from top to bottom.\n","\n","### 從 Python 的角度而言 From Python's point of view\n","當一個 Python 檔案被執行時，其中的程序會先被轉換成 ` 位元組碼 ` 。原因是位元組碼比原來的 Python 程序語言運行得更快。但是，開發人員並不會看見這個轉換。只有在 Python 程序需被寫入存取電腦時，一個 ` \".pyc\" ` 位元組碼的代碼擴充檔案才會被創建。\n","\n","當程序被編釋成位元組碼後，它會被轉移到 ` Python 虛擬機 (PVM) `。PVM 是用以重覆位元組碼指令的一個巨大迴圈，亦是實際上用作執行程序的元件。\n","\n","When a Python file is executed, the source code is first compiled into `byte code`. The reason for such translation is because byte code can be run more quickly compared with the original source code in the Python file. Yet, the above-mentioned is almost hidden from the user. Only when the Python process has to write access on the machine, a byte code file is created with a `\".pyc\"` extension.\n","\n","After the programme has been compiled to byte code, it is transferred to the `Python Virtual Machine (PVM)`. PVM is a big loop iterating the byte code instructions and is the component that actually runs the codes.\n","\n","\n","\n","![title](ExecutionModel.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4_vnULe4y2bq"},"source":["### Python 程序能分解成: Python programmes can be decomposed as follows:\n","\n","1. 程序由模組組成 Programme is composed of modules\n","2. 模組中有程式語句 Modules contain statements\n","3. 程式語句中有程序表達式 Statements contain expressions\n","4. 程序表達式創造並處理物件 Expressions create and process objects\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Neiihjgoy2bs"},"source":["## 一起來用 Jupyter Notebook 創造第一個 Python 程序吧 \n","## Let's run your first-ever Python programme with Jupyter Notebook\n","\n","\n","在下方的一格中，列出了一個簡單的程式。這個函式運用 ` print ` 函式列印一段 \"Hello World!\" 訊息。\n","\n","按下 `shift + enter` 或 `ctrl + enter` 以運行在下方一格中的程序。\n","\n","In the following cell, a simple programme is written.
