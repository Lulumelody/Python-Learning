It keeps looping back to the start of the statement until the test becomes false. The statement follows the `while` block after the test becomes false. If the test of a `while` is false from the beginning, the statement within the `while` block never runs.\n","\n","The figure above is a logic flow chart illustrating how a `while` loop works. First of all, a variable `i` is assigned with a value of 1. Then, the loop test evaluates if `i` is smaller or equal to 10. If yes, the code within the `while` loop is executed, that is to print a string `'Hello World!'`. Then, `i` is incremented by 1. The process ends when the test becomes false, that is when `i` is not longer smaller or equal to 10.\n","\n","You may wonder why is `i` incremented by 1 every time when the block of codes is executed. The reason behind is to avoid `infinite loop`. An `infinite loop` refers to the test of a `while` loop never becomes `false`. By incrementing `i` by 1 enables to process to ends after repeating for 11 times.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"leEKQYcpjT_G"},"source":["i = 0\n","\n","while i <= 10:\n","    print('Hello World!')\n","    i = i + 1"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pz0BqAntjT_H"},"source":["其他 `While` 迴圈的例子:\n","\n","Other examples of `while` loop:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3Z7lXgonjT_I","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637743378984,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":738,"user":{"displayName":"gotit gotit","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"01470946776148000258"}},"outputId":"dd115d59-43ba-4c5d-94e6-87571e81a79e"},"source":["x = 0\n","y = 20\n","\n","while x < y:\n","    print(x, end=' ')\n","    x += 1\n","    "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 "]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"jl3SJWzUjT_I"},"source":["total = 0\n","money = 0\n","count = 0\n","\n","while total < 10000:\n","    name = input('Please input your name: ')\n","    money = abs(int(input('Please input the amount for donation: ')))\n","    total += money\n","    count += 1\n","    print('Thank you %s for your donation of $%d' %(name, money))\n","    \n","print('Thank you all for supporting!
